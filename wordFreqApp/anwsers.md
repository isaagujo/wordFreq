How long time did you end up spending on this coding test?

On the JS solution I ended up spending about 30 hours, then I also spent addionally
around 10 hours on styling in CSS and animating.

Explain why you chose the code structure(s) you used in your solution.

Primarly I choose to present a solution with PHP hoping to get to show those skills as well but when I was done I noticed making alot of HTTP request did not benefit the speed of the program so I decided to solve it with simply JS. I structured the code in function that returned values to not nest them if in the future more functions wanted to be added it would be easy to build uppon. I also named everyhting after what they do or get or are hoping that would make it easyer for other people to read the solution.

What would you add to your solution if you had more time? This question is especially important if you did not spend much time on the coding test - use this as an opportunity to explain what your solution is missing.

Three main things I would've liked to figure out a regex pattern that recongnized the most used word also when it was written in plural.

Secondarly I would have like to look further into how to return a promise from an async function, in that case would've been able to have all code out nested. I would have made a callback function to get it

Third was also present end-user with a choice if the text had more than one most common word. I would have solved this by go thrue the word array since I had the variable for frequancy to and if I've goten more then one variable back I could make a case where I could alert the end-user if they wanted to 'foobar' both word or one of them.  

What did you think of this recruitment test?

It was a really fun test, good amount of time that made it really un-stressfull. Also you where able to solve the problem in many diffrent way that I think made it easier for alot of people to be able to show something they are good at!
